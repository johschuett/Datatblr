The Datatblr program generates a table volume containing the univariate description of all metric and categorical variables of a data set. Datatblr delivers the table volume as LaTeX and PDF-file.

Datatblr is suitable for generating table volumes that typically appear in the appendix of research reports, or for the preparation of more detailed analysis.

### Dependencies
* R base (3.6.3 or newer)  [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
  * [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html) package
  * [rio](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rio/index.html) package
* LaTeX [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)

#### To build the program:
* G++ compiler (std=c++17)
* Make

### Release

We recommend downloading the latest **stable release** of the program. If you download the program from the master branch, there is a chance that it may be unstable or not run at all.

### Installation

The user interface is compatible with **UNIX** systems. If you are running **Windows**, you have to work directly with the R files! (You might want to check out the lite version.)

#### Build

To build the Datatblr user interface, switch to the project folder, and run:

```shell
sh build.sh
```

#### Run

The program is operated via a console (Terminal), either by double-clicking on the executable (datatblr) or running the command:

```shell
./datatblr
```
#### Set R working directory

You can move the executable as you like. Make sure to set your R working directory to `/path/to/datatblr` **or** move the `dtblr_core` folder into your working directory. There, Datatblr saves the table volume (TEX and PDF).

You can set your working directory in your `.Rprofile` with this command:

```R
setwd("/path/to/working_directory")
```

You can also add the path of the executable to your PATH environment variable and then run the program using the command `datatblr`.

### Usage example

Open Datatblr via a console:

```shell
./datatblr
```
and follow the instructions step by step.

**or**

Copy your data and your meta file to your R working directory and run:

```shell
./datatblr data.csv meta.csv 1
```

to generate a table volume with *summarized missings*.

Alternatively, you can exchange the 1 with a 2 to generate a table volume *without missings*:

```shell
./datatblr data.csv meta.csv 2
```
